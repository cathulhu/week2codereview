Logic Specs

* take input of search string and target string.
* iterate through search string and detect matching characters, in sequence, in total, of the target string in the search string.
* return number of occurrences

test1, Input= search="cat", target="cat"
       output= 1
       why? this should test the positive ID of the perfect match functionality

test1,  Input= search="catcat", target="cat"
        output= 1
        why? this should test the negative ID of the perfect match functionality

test1,  Input= search="catcatcat", target="cat"
        output= 3
        why? test of substring detection functionality, should pickup the 3 occurrences

test1,  Input= search="catzzacatcatacartcat", target="cat"
        output= 4
        why? test of substring detection functionality in the face of non contiguous occurrences, partial matches, and longer string
        output should be 4

Interface Specs

* User should have a form to enter the string to search
  * Form should also contain a field for the target string to search for

* After submission a new page will relate the string that was searched and note any occurrences of the target string
